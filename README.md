# Sheetmate

Sheetmate is a collaborative spreadsheet application that allows multiple users to work on a spreadsheet in real-time. It consists of two main components: the backend (server-side) and the frontend (client-side).

## Features

- Real-time collaboration: Multiple users can edit the same spreadsheet simultaneously.
- User authentication: Securely log in to your account to access and manage your spreadsheets.
- Intuitive interface: User-friendly design to make spreadsheet editing and collaboration easy.

## Components

### Backend

The backend is responsible for handling data storage, user authentication, and managing real-time updates.
